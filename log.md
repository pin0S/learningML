# 100 Days Of ML Code - Captains Log

## Day 1: August 06, 2018

Today's Progress: I learnt about vectors, real coordinate spaces and how to add vectors algebraically and graphically. 
I also learnt how to multiply a vector by a scalar.


Thoughts: It was a really good start, happy I posted it on Instagram to keep me committed and I'll also be tweeting and logging it. 
Let's get it! Vectors are simple so far although I need to speed up my learning as I didn't get as far as I wanted to will continue in
the moring, getting more of vectors done before work. 

## Day 2: August 07, 2018

Today's Progress: Continued working with Vectors, learn't about adding, subtracting and scaling them also how to 
determine the coordinates using magnitude and direct of two vectors.

Thoughts: The math is a little more challenging than I thought it would be, mostly because I'm brushing off a lot of cobwebs 
from math I haven't used E.g Trigonometry. Despite the math being a little more of a swallow learning curve than expected, 
I find myself really enjoying it. I regret not doing more of it in school. I get a real sense of achievement for working on it 
and it really excites me.

Some good resources I need to add to the repo are 1Blue3Brown. I love that guy, his enthusiasm and passion for his subjects 
really draw me in and motivate me to go on!

## Day 3: August 08, 2018

Today's Progress: Worked further through Khan academenies linear algebra course, tested what I had been learning by
going through Andrew Ng's Linear alegra section of his course and bang I was doing  a lot better than my first attempt.

Thoughts: I realised today, more so than previous days that I am on a crunched timeline. Thus I need to learn only what I need to 
learn, so instead of meticulously working through each subject of math I need to cover. I should be stream lining it to what I need
for Machine learning. Hence, why I decided to attempt Andrew Ng's Linear Algebra portion of the course.

I am going to update the Math sections with the specific subject matter I find you need to know for each umbrella subject of math. 

## Day 4: August 09, 2018

Today's Progress: Worked on week on of Andrew Ng's course, finding that the first 2-3 days I spent on linear algebra really helped me
understand not just the concept of linear regression but also with maths in general. 

Thoughts: Andrew has a great way of explaining things, I just need to be paitent. I think in my first attempt I was not paitent 
enough and tried to rush through the course. 

Each day I've been spending around 2 - 3 hours studying which is right where I want to be on week days. Weekends I can hopefully 
ramp up. 

## Day 5: August 10, 2018

Today's Progress: Continued working through Andrew Ng's course got through gradient descent. 

Thoughts: I know it's going to get harder, but I'm really happy with my attention to detail and how I am working through the
the problems. My note taking is great and I'm being paitent which I need to continue reminding myself to do.

## Day 6: August 11, 2018

Today's Progress: Had my first quiz in the course, got 4/5 the first time and then quickly worked through my notes and got
5/5 the second time around. 

Thoughts: Again I know it is going to get harder but the progress from my first failed attempt to now is great! I'm concerned
my python skills are going to drop off while I'm working through the math so I'm ensuring I'm doing pybites challenges and 
trying to help other learners.

## Day 7: August 12, 2018

Today's Progress: Started Week 2 of Coursea course and working through matrices multiplication. 

Thoughts:Short day, with city to surf run. Looking forward to smashing through this week and really testing where I am. 

## Day 8: August 13, 2018

Today's Progress: Powering through week 2, finished all the multivariate section. 

Thoughts: I will need to review matrices on Khan academy tonight to make sure I understand how matrices multiplication works. 
I am also hoping to get through to week three so that I am still on track with calculus. I've definitely changed my structure in terms of what is working best. Rather than purely learning the maths, I'm finding it best to go through Andrew's course and then supplement math when I don't understand. This allows me to just learn what I need to learn cutting down a lot of time and helping me focus on what's important. 

## Day 9: August 14, 2018

Today's Progress: Week 2 all done from a maths stand point, only the octave videos to go through

Thoughts: Although I know Python is the main programming language for ML, I'm excited to get a look at another languages syntax. Math keeps being exciting to me, I often consider doing some part time study for it just not sure if that is where I should be investing my time. 

## Day 10: August 15, 2018

Today's Progress: Quiz passed, took until attempt 3 to get 5 out of 5 and I know I will fail but I won't ever quit.

Thoughts: Really happy I passed was concerned about linear alegra. Although I think I have only touched the sides of the course, my main aim is to get to where I am training my own models as quickly as possible as that is how I learn best. 

I may have said this already but 3Blue1Brown is such a fantastic resources, that dude is amazing. 


## Day 11: August 16, 2018

Today's Progress: I had to revisit Octave, the syntax wasn't clear 

Thoughts: I definitely rushed through that section, key learning and I keep saying this is been patient. If I look at how far I've come from day 1 it is already crazy progress so no need to rush obviously this is longer than a 100 day journey it will gone on long after I've finsihed my 100 day log. 

Looking forward to the weekend with friends, although a little melancholy I won't be able to dedicate 8 hours + to ML. I will still get my 1-2 hours in. 

## Day 12: August 17, 2018

Today's Progress: Finished going through Octave at the airport

Thoughts: THe syntax is fine as always you have to google things and look up the documentation as you go. Won't get heaps donw over the weekend as I'm catching up with the guys in Melbourne. 

## Day 13 & 14: August, 18 & 19, 2018

Progress: Spent time just going through Sentdex starcraft tutorial as that is the area of deep learning the excited me to get into Machine learning

Thoughts: A lessoned learned for this up comming weekend in which I have Pycon AU I need to get up early to go through my study so that I can also enjoy Pycon with out worrying where I will fit the time in for study. 

## Day 15: August 20, 2018

Today's Progress: Assignemnt done (except the optional part which I will do during the week) onto week 3 Logistic regression

Thoughts: Often I feel like I'm not getting anywhere or learning what I should be. I constantly struggle with the thought of trying another course and then may be it will all click. But I need to keep reminding myself that before I started I wasn't sure what gradient descent was or what logisic regression was. Paitence, Paitence and Paitence is what I need to keep preaching to myself. 

## Day 16: August 21, 2018

Today's Progress: Started on Classification and logistic regression. Within that I learnt how to represent the hypothesis which is different to logistic regression as we now use the sigmoid function. I also learnt about the decision boundary which is essentially the line that seperates the area where y=0 and where y=1. Now I am working on the cost function of linear regression. 

Thoughts: I haven't really felt like I don't understand anything in the course yet. I think it is more the granularity that I don't have particularly with the maths. I am giving strong consideration to taking the udacity maths for machine learning course in parallel to the current course. 

It is important to not have limiting thoughts, I keep it positive and reinforce it by telling myself anyone can learn this and I just have to break it down into a way I understand. 

Machine learning and AI has me so excited for my future and while I still love marketing the dream would be to find a nice cross over point. 

## Day 17: August 22, 2018

Today's Progress: Continued working through week 3, primairyly on advanced optimisation and multiclass classification. 

Thoughts: Was a bit tired today and my mind kept jumping around, I know I will get there and I have come so far there is just always that little bit of doubt in the mind. 

## Day 18: August 23, 2018

Today's Progress: Finished part 1 of week 3 and bombed the test. Not sure if it was because I was rushing or because I didn't understand the course material.

Thoughts: The concept of Machine learning and in this instance classification is fine I feel like I understand what the algorithm is trying to achieve and why. 

What I need to better understand and be more confident in is reading the equation. I'm going to devert more time on math than I have been to ensure I understand what is happening so that when I hit the tests, I'm not uncertain about what is happening. I'm also going to spend a little bit of time on the forums also to see if others are running into the same issues and then see how they solved them.

## Day 19: August 24, 2018

Today's Progress: Spent time on Linear Algebra and watching sentdex star craft tutorial

Thoughts: By the end of the working week I'm pretty tired, I really notice it  by how deep of a sleep I am in when I wake up. I'm thinking I need to do some push ups or something to get my brain humming. 

The more I think about I think I need to be working on a project that excited me, sentdex made a fantastic point that one of the best ways to learn about anything is start and when you don't know what something is, go away learn it and then come back and see if you understand it. I guess that is sort of what I am doing right now with AN's course. 

I'm thinking about building my own card game and getting my deep learning machine to play games against itself. Although maybe to start I'm better off starting with some Atari games. 

One of my 100 days of code responders, had a great thought - 'Progress is progress'. 

## Day 20: August 25, 2018

Today's Progreess: Went to Pyconau today and listened to some interesting talks on how Python is used in Games, using Python to automate excel and how machine learning is effecting art. 

Thoughts: The artwork talk blew my mind and continued to inspire me to learn machine learning. The speaker talked about GANs and transfer learning to create otherworldly images. I'm definitely going to try this on a data set. 

## Day 21: August 26, 2018

Today's Progress: Pyconau Day 2, heard some more interesting talks and worked on my 100 days of code book

Thoughts: The talk by Tracy really inspired me to try and learn by doing and be happy to fail which I think I am after getting started on my book. It also made me realise I need to find a corner stone project for my machine learning - I am leaning on a Deep learning bot and making a chatbot using south park scripts probably Cartman, which I think would make a great tutorial. 

## Day 22: August 27, 2018

Today's Progress: Today I set up the Kanban post it note system to help me stay on task, I also did some more Vectors study. 

Thoughts: Setting up the Kanban with key learning objects will help speed up my time I need to learn the math of machine learning by keeping me on task.I also left my keys at home the one night Rosie wasn't home before me and was actually at the movies until 9pm! So I sat in Grilld and read an 'introduction to machine learning with python' which had some interesting points binary classification and what overfitting and underfitting are. The later was really interesting as we I worked in consulting I'd hear the analyst talk about ti but I never truely understood what they were talking about now I do :). 


## Day 23: August 28, 2018

Today's progress: Today I continued with the coursera ML course, I passed the WK 3 half way quiz although I found it quite difficult and only got 4/5 so some work needs to be done to better understand logistic regression. I then moved onto part 2 of week 3 overfitting and regularisation. 

Thoughts: Supplementing my work with the ML book was really helpful, reading about over fitting before I actually tackeled it in the course was really helpful in me understanding the topic. Regularisation is the next thing I need to read up about. On a side note the 100 days of code book is up to 13 people committed to helping +1 if you include Glyn but I doubt he does it. 


## Day 24: August 29, 2018

Today's progess: Two sections of overfitting and regularisation done. Making sure I take good notes and that I understand the content as best I can. 

Thoughts: I need to supplement more of my learning, going to get some OCdevL syllabus materials and share those with my instagram followers. The course what give me everything I need as I am quite far behind in terms of the knowledge I need from this field. Thus I need to use other resources to beef out my learning.  

## Day 25: August 30, 2018

c Completed the regularisation quiz on my second attempt, I feel I understand overfitting and underfitting well. I also started the week 3 assignment and had no idea what I was doing! 

Thoughts: I'm not sure if it is the octave syntax or my just not learning the materials well enough but I sturggle to do the assignments. I took something from rewatching Jabrils how to learn machine learning video and that was, when I don't understand something - I should go and research it independently until I do understand it. 

## Day 26: August 31, 2018

Today's progress: Continued with the quiz, but this time I'm writing out my solutions in my notes and making sure I really understand what is happening with the code and as yesterday mentioned, when I don't understand something I make sure I go and research it independently so tomorrow I am going to look into what transpose is and thus do more work on linear alegbra. 

Thoughts: I wanted to rush through and get to deep learning as quick as possible, unfortunately I am going to have to take my time a little more to make sure I understand the concepts. The postive of this is I can keep all those notes in my onenote and book and then write about them to help others, hopefully I can be a bit of a pioneer in the space (no coding and no machine learning/math of machine learning knowledge) and thus encourage others to give it a go. 

## Day 27: September 1, 2018

Today's progress: Not huge amounts of progress today I spent most of the morning understanding what is happening in 1.2.2 of the assignment. Determined to do more of it tomorrow. 

Thoughts: I had a great time walking with my partner and her friends from the split bridge to Manly. Getting outside and doing positive things for myself is so rewarding. I also had the chance to chat to Darren someone who has just completed their masters in computer science majoring in ai. He gave me some fantastic insight and the chat really excited me, which is a real positive in my mind as I was passionate and keenly interested in what he had to say about the field. It really hit home for me that this is an area I am deeply interested in and want to become more involved in. 

## Day 28: September 2, 2018

Today's progress: Again not a lot of progress today a little more work on the assigment.

Thoughts: I'm letting myself down on the weekends and I think it's potentially because I'm telling myself I will have all day to study. Instead I need to be coming into the weekend with a plan of what I need to learn and the goals for that learning. So right now I know I need to better understand how gradient descent, cost function all work to produce what we are doing in octave. I have some books to supplement that now. 

## Day 29: September 3, 2018

Today's Progress: Finished the assignment was hard! Also found this awesome series on logistic regression https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN5cNN2-HWE.

Thoughts: Revisit the math and supplement it with books

## Day 30: September 4, 2018

Today's Progress: Continued week 4 of Andrew Ng's course looking a neural networks

Thoughts: Today the math hit hard! I understood the basic concept of a neural network and how all the inputs feed into the hidden layer that is used to produce the hypothesis. However, I did not understand the calculations behind it and was a bit thrown by the course. So I've made the decision to really focus this week on linear algebra. I want to move all the pink post its to the learnt side. 

## Day 31: September 5, 2018

Today's Progress: Started taking linear algebra notes on my one note so I have a resource I can look back to

Thoughts: A combination of books, short form videos and effective not taking work the best for me. Also slowing down videos instead of trying to watch them at 2x is much better for me. I just don't take it in a 2x or probably even 1.5x so I end up rewatching the video thus making my study even more ineffective. 

## Day 32: September 6, 2018

Today's Progress: Did not do much today, minimal 15 - 30 minutes at best on linear algebra. 

Thoughts: The 10pm work night ruined me! I needed to be more disciplined when I got up at 6am and ensured I did some study. Progress is Progress after all. 

## Day 33: September 7, 2018

Today's Progress: Moved the linear independence, basis and dimension post it to the right and I think tonight dot ptoduct, modulus and negation will be moved! 

Thoughts: Make sure I include this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeMJg4uI7o0 in my notes to help others. Dr. Strang explains things wonderfully. Also add more tonight after studying! 

## Day 34: September 8, 2018

Today's Progress: Day dedicated to learning about matrix on khan academy

Thoughts: Although it feels like a backwards step, it is ok to work on the basics. I also enjoy reading and watching AI content. I have a genuine interest in this area, the thought of working withAI and building AI gives me serious excitment. 

## Day 35: September 9, 2018

Today's Progress: Continued to dedicated the day to learning about matrix on khan academy

Thoughts: I really enjoy math, I wish I had pursued it more in Univeristy. There is not time like the present I guess. 

## Day 36: September 10, 2018

Today's Progress: Nearly there with matrix got up at 5am to work on it should be done by tomorrow

Thoughts: It is interesting on the days that I don't actually look at any machine learning content and just focus on the math I still enjoy it. Really enjoy it. I just can't wait until I'm creating my own analysis and solving my own problems. Although I know it will take time.

## Day 37: September 11, 2018

Today's Progress: All done with matrices basics finished them tonight passed tests and ready to dive back into linear algebra. 

Thoughts: Feeling great about maths, you know when you have those moments when everything is click and making sense after the accumulation of hours of frustrated study...that is me right now. I need to remember that feeling. I'm not going to lie for a while there I've definitely thought as one is want to do, that I couldn't learn ML, that perhaps it was above me. However, it's not anyone can learn anything you just have to work hard to achieve it. 

I was still feeling quite tired from the range review presentation at work yesterday so studying at night and getting the motivation was hard, but I managed to get through that feeling and put in some good study. 

## Day 38: September 12, 2018

Today's progress: Quick review of vector basics to make sure I understand basic operations, then back into linear alegbra finalising dot and cross product and ready to move into Matrices in linear algebra :)

Thoughts: This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYB8IZa5AuE&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=3) = the best video for helping you to understand linear transformations! I just couldn't conceptualise it from reading Strang or even Khan academy then bam! I better understood it, although I don't doubt I will have to watch it again. This shows me that utilising a combo of resources is how I learn, I need to view something from differnet angles to better understand it. 

## Day 39: September 13, 2018

Today's progress: Pushing my way through matrices, got through one lecture on khan academy after my alarm went off late

Thoughts: I know I have been harping on about this but things are clicking. It has made me realise that going though the math is so fundamental to understanding the underlying concepts of machine learning. Going through the pain now will pay off massively down the track is my assumption. 

## Day 40: September 14, 2018

Today's progress: Worked my way through row echelon and why it is useful. All this work makes it so much easier actually understanding what Andrew Ng is talking about. 

Thoughts: The first 40 days have been fantastic, I'm looking forward to my holiday but I also can't wait to get back into it. Feeling really determined to get this done and ensure I keep my positive self talk up that I can learn the math and that I will get to where I want to go and that is making my own deep learning problemns! 

## Day 41: October 2, 2018

Today's Progress: Completed the linear alegebra section of the Andrew Ng course

Thoughts: I feel so recharged after my two weeks holiday in NZ. It is going to take a little bit of time to get back into the routine and get the brain pumping again but I'm excited about the next 60 days. 

I can't believe I missed the linear algebra section in the course the first time through!!! I'm lucky I went back to revise it. Now my plan for the week is to see how much of the course I understand after all my maths work so revision is big this week. After spending a little time on it already I realise that I shouldn't be just forcing myself forward, I should be ensuring I understand what is going on before I move on. 

## Day 42: October 3, 2018

Today's Progress: Continued revision got most of the way through week 2

Thoughts: Revision again has been fantastic, I did stumble upon an awesome video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc7RiNgHHaE. The work done in this video the exploration and the trial and error really interests me, it's why I wanted to get into ML to work on cool an engaging projects like this. 

## Day 43: October 4, 2018

Today's Progress: Week 2 nearly done for revision

Thoughts: Getting the feeling of creativity back, having some great ideas for what I want to do with Machine learning after I'm done with the basics. It's funny because with all the time I am spending learning I don't have time for one of my favourite past times gaming, but soon hopefully I will be able to automate a machine to do my gaming for me ha. 

As I take my time and go back through the course I feel like I am really grasping the concepts, redoing the assignments which I initally struggled with should be a strong litmus test for where I am at. 

## Day 44: October 5, 2018

Today's Progress: All bar one video for week 2 left to go then I am on to week 3

Thoughts: I want to finish week three tomorrow so I can do the assignment and really test where I am at. Going to be a busy weekend, I have a lot to think about espically with the job opportunity curve ball I've been through at work which would essentially mean less time for coding :( but a really good opportunity none the less and I should be able to make it work. 

## Day 45: October 6, 2018

Today's Progress: Week 2 done and throughly I would say so

Thoughts: Revision is smart, but I am also leaning towards finding a project to start soon. Either training a game or chat bot is what I am leaning towards. 

## Day 46: October 7, 2018

Today's Progress: Worked on the first assignment make sure I understood what was happening with the code and the equations

Thoughts: Spending time working on the assignment is hugely benefical, I feel more ready to tackle the next section tomorrow and then to move onto week 3, hopefully I can get to neural nets by mid week. However, I'm not going to rush it this time but rather make sure I understand what is going on. 

Machine learning is such a cool world and I want to make great projects. However, I know I am going to have to take it slow and work my way up to doing those great projects. I might even study again...

## Day 47: October 8, 2018

Today's Progress: Continued with the extra credit work on the first assignment, only got through the first part feature scaling which I'm happy about as I am really starting to get better at Octave and understanding what the code is doing

Thoughts: Although I am tempted to keep going with the lectures and revision, I have to stop myself and remember that the hard work now and the slow progress is ok. As progress is progress and the knowledge is really sinking in. 

## Day 48: October 9, 2018

Today's Progress: Finished the assignment and took detailed notes on how I figured out each section

Thoughts: The assignment was still hard but I learnt a lot more this time around than the first time I attempted it. That was through understanding the octave code and the maths behind it

## Day 49: October 10, 2018

Today's progress: Logistic regression revision continued 

Thoughts: As I update my notes, I can see I rushed through/half arsed the note taking the first time. Big time lesson that keeps coming home to roost is that if I don't understand something I need to stop and spend time to understand it before I move on. As the next video is unlikely to explain it as it assumes I've understood the past video. 

## Day 50: October 11, 2018 

Todays progress: Went through logistic regress so I had a solid understanding of it

Thoughts: This video for logistic regression is an absolute gem https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfKanl1aSG0. I has really helped my understand what is going on with the sigmoid function and how to get to the final product

## -- missed my first day in a long time work too crazy + hung over :( --

## Day 51: October 13, 2018
