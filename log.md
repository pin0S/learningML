# 100 Days Of ML Code - Captains Log

## Day 1: August 06, 2018

Today's Progress: I learnt about vectors, real coordinate spaces and how to add vectors algebraically and graphically. 
I also learnt how to multiply a vector by a scalar.


Thoughts: It was a really good start, happy I posted it on Instagram to keep me committed and I'll also be tweeting and logging it. 
Let's get it! Vectors are simple so far although I need to speed up my learning as I didn't get as far as I wanted to will continue in
the moring, getting more of vectors done before work. 

## Day 2: August 07, 2018

Today's Progress: Continued working with Vectors, learn't about adding, subtracting and scaling them also how to 
determine the coordinates using magnitude and direct of two vectors.

Thoughts: The math is a little more challenging than I thought it would be, mostly because I'm brushing off a lot of cobwebs 
from math I haven't used E.g Trigonometry. Despite the math being a little more of a swallow learning curve than expected, 
I find myself really enjoying it. I regret not doing more of it in school. I get a real sense of achievement for working on it 
and it really excites me.

Some good resources I need to add to the repo are 1Blue3Brown. I love that guy, his enthusiasm and passion for his subjects 
really draw me in and motivate me to go on!

## Day 3: August 08, 2018

Today's Progress: Worked further through Khan academenies linear algebra course, tested what I had been learning by
going through Andrew Ng's Linear alegra section of his course and bang I was doing  a lot better than my first attempt.

Thoughts: I realised today, more so than previous days that I am on a crunched timeline. Thus I need to learn only what I need to 
learn, so instead of meticulously working through each subject of math I need to cover. I should be stream lining it to what I need
for Machine learning. Hence, why I decided to attempt Andrew Ng's Linear Algebra portion of the course.

I am going to update the Math sections with the specific subject matter I find you need to know for each umbrella subject of math. 

## Day 4: August 09, 2018

Today's Progress: Worked on week on of Andrew Ng's course, finding that the first 2-3 days I spent on linear algebra really helped me
understand not just the concept of linear regression but also with maths in general. 

Thoughts: Andrew has a great way of explaining things, I just need to be paitent. I think in my first attempt I was not paitent 
enough and tried to rush through the course. 

Each day I've been spending around 2 - 3 hours studying which is right where I want to be on week days. Weekends I can hopefully 
ramp up. 

## Day 5: August 10, 2018

Today's Progress: Continued working through Andrew Ng's course got through gradient descent. 

Thoughts: I know it's going to get harder, but I'm really happy with my attention to detail and how I am working through the
the problems. My note taking is great and I'm being paitent which I need to continue reminding myself to do.

## Day 6: August 11, 2018

Today's Progress: Had my first quiz in the course, got 4/5 the first time and then quickly worked through my notes and got
5/5 the second time around. 

Thoughts: Again I know it is going to get harder but the progress from my first failed attempt to now is great! I'm concerned
my python skills are going to drop off while I'm working through the math so I'm ensuring I'm doing pybites challenges and 
trying to help other learners.

## Day 7: August 12, 2018

Today's Progress: Started Week 2 of Coursea course and working through matrices multiplication. 

Thoughts:Short day, with city to surf run. Looking forward to smashing through this week and really testing where I am. 

## Day 8: August 13, 2018

Today's Progress: Powering through week 2, finished all the multivariate section. 

Thoughts: I will need to review matrices on Khan academy tonight to make sure I understand how matrices multiplication works. 
I am also hoping to get through to week three so that I am still on track with calculus. I've definitely changed my structure in terms of what is working best. Rather than purely learning the maths, I'm finding it best to go through Andrew's course and then supplement math when I don't understand. This allows me to just learn what I need to learn cutting down a lot of time and helping me focus on what's important. 

## Day 9: August 14, 2018

Today's Progress: Week 2 all done from a maths stand point, only the octave videos to go through

Thoughts: Although I know Python is the main programming language for ML, I'm excited to get a look at another languages syntax. Math keeps being exciting to me, I often consider doing some part time study for it just not sure if that is where I should be investing my time. 

## Day 10: August 15, 2018

Today's Progress: Quiz passed, took until attempt 3 to get 5 out of 5 and I know I will fail but I won't ever quit.

Thoughts: Really happy I passed was concerned about linear alegra. Although I think I have only touched the sides of the course, my main aim is to get to where I am training my own models as quickly as possible as that is how I learn best. 

I may have said this already but 3Blue1Brown is such a fantastic resources, that dude is amazing. 


## Day 11: August 16, 2018

Today's Progress: I had to revisit Octave, the syntax wasn't clear 

Thoughts: I definitely rushed through that section, key learning and I keep saying this is been patient. If I look at how far I've come from day 1 it is already crazy progress so no need to rush obviously this is longer than a 100 day journey it will gone on long after I've finsihed my 100 day log. 

Looking forward to the weekend with friends, although a little melancholy I won't be able to dedicate 8 hours + to ML. I will still get my 1-2 hours in. 

## Day 12: August 17, 2018

Today's Progress: Finished going through Octave at the airport

Thoughts: THe syntax is fine as always you have to google things and look up the documentation as you go. Won't get heaps donw over the weekend as I'm catching up with the guys in Melbourne. 

## Day 13 & 14: August, 18 & 19, 2018

Progress: Spent time just going through Sentdex starcraft tutorial as that is the area of deep learning the excited me to get into Machine learning

Thoughts: A lessoned learned for this up comming weekend in which I have Pycon AU I need to get up early to go through my study so that I can also enjoy Pycon with out worrying where I will fit the time in for study. 

## Day 15: August 20, 2018

Today's Progress: Assignemnt done (except the optional part which I will do during the week) onto week 3 Logistic regression

Thoughts: Often I feel like I'm not getting anywhere or learning what I should be. I constantly struggle with the thought of trying another course and then may be it will all click. But I need to keep reminding myself that before I started I wasn't sure what gradient descent was or what logisic regression was. Paitence, Paitence and Paitence is what I need to keep preaching to myself. 

## Day 16: August 21, 2018

Today's Progress: Started on Classification and logistic regression. Within that I learnt how to represent the hypothesis which is different to logistic regression as we now use the sigmoid function. I also learnt about the decision boundary which is essentially the line that seperates the area where y=0 and where y=1. Now I am working on the cost function of linear regression. 

Thoughts: I haven't really felt like I don't understand anything in the course yet. I think it is more the granularity that I don't have particularly with the maths. I am giving strong consideration to taking the udacity maths for machine learning course in parallel to the current course. 

It is important to not have limiting thoughts, I keep it positive and reinforce it by telling myself anyone can learn this and I just have to break it down into a way I understand. 

Machine learning and AI has me so excited for my future and while I still love marketing the dream would be to find a nice cross over point. 

## Day 17: August 22, 2018

Today's Progress: Continued working through week 3, primairyly on advanced optimisation and multiclass classification. 

Thoughts: Was a bit tired today and my mind kept jumping around, I know I will get there and I have come so far there is just always that little bit of doubt in the mind. 

## Day 18: August 23, 2018

Today's Progress: Finished part 1 of week 3 and bombed the test. Not sure if it was because I was rushing or because I didn't understand the course material.

Thoughts: The concept of Machine learning and in this instance classification is fine I feel like I understand what the algorithm is trying to achieve and why. 

What I need to better understand and be more confident in is reading the equation. I'm going to devert more time on math than I have been to ensure I understand what is happening so that when I hit the tests, I'm not uncertain about what is happening. I'm also going to spend a little bit of time on the forums also to see if others are running into the same issues and then see how they solved them.

## Day 19: August 24, 2018

Today's Progress: Spent time on Linear Algebra and watching sentdex star craft tutorial

Thoughts: By the end of the working week I'm pretty tired, I really notice it  by how deep of a sleep I am in when I wake up. I'm thinking I need to do some push ups or something to get my brain humming. 

The more I think about I think I need to be working on a project that excited me, sentdex made a fantastic point that one of the best ways to learn about anything is start and when you don't know what something is, go away learn it and then come back and see if you understand it. I guess that is sort of what I am doing right now with AN's course. 

I'm thinking about building my own card game and getting my deep learning machine to play games against itself. Although maybe to start I'm better off starting with some Atari games. 

One of my 100 days of code responders, had a great thought - 'Progress is progress'. 

## Day 20: August 25, 2018

Today's Progreess: Went to Pyconau today and listened to some interesting talks on how Python is used in Games, using Python to automate excel and how machine learning is effecting art. 

Thoughts: The artwork talk blew my mind and continued to inspire me to learn machine learning. The speaker talked about GANs and transfer learning to create otherworldly images. I'm definitely going to try this on a data set. 

## Day 21: August 26, 2018

Today's Progress: Pyconau Day 2, heard some more interesting talks and worked on my 100 days of code book

Thoughts: The talk by Tracy really inspired me to try and learn by doing and be happy to fail which I think I am after getting started on my book. It also made me realise I need to find a corner stone project for my machine learning - I am leaning on a Deep learning bot and making a chatbot using south park scripts probably Cartman, which I think would make a great tutorial. 

## Day 22: August 27, 2018

Today's Progress: Today I set up the Kanban post it note system to help me stay on task, I also did some more Vectors study. 

Thoughts: Setting up the Kanban with key learning objects will help speed up my time I need to learn the math of machine learning by keeping me on task.I also left my keys at home the one night Rosie wasn't home before me and was actually at the movies until 9pm! So I sat in Grilld and read an 'introduction to machine learning with python' which had some interesting points binary classification and what overfitting and underfitting are. The later was really interesting as we I worked in consulting I'd hear the analyst talk about ti but I never truely understood what they were talking about now I do :). 


## Day 23: August 28, 2018

Today's progress: Today I continued with the coursera ML course, I passed the WK 3 half way quiz although I found it quite difficult and only got 4/5 so some work needs to be done to better understand logistic regression. I then moved onto part 2 of week 3 overfitting and regularisation. 

Thoughts: Supplementing my work with the ML book was really helpful, reading about over fitting before I actually tackeled it in the course was really helpful in me understanding the topic. Regularisation is the next thing I need to read up about. On a side note the 100 days of code book is up to 13 people committed to helping +1 if you include Glyn but I doubt he does it. 


## Day 24: August 29, 2018

Today's progess: Two sections of overfitting and regularisation done. Making sure I take good notes and that I understand the content as best I can. 

Thoughts: I need to supplement more of my learning, going to get some OCdevL syllabus materials and share those with my instagram followers. The course what give me everything I need as I am quite far behind in terms of the knowledge I need from this field. Thus I need to use other resources to beef out my learning.  

## Day 25: August 30, 2018

c Completed the regularisation quiz on my second attempt, I feel I understand overfitting and underfitting well. I also started the week 3 assignment and had no idea what I was doing! 

Thoughts: I'm not sure if it is the octave syntax or my just not learning the materials well enough but I sturggle to do the assignments. I took something from rewatching Jabrils how to learn machine learning video and that was, when I don't understand something - I should go and research it independently until I do understand it. 

## Day 26: August 31, 2018

Today's progress: Continued with the quiz, but this time I'm writing out my solutions in my notes and making sure I really understand what is happening with the code and as yesterday mentioned, when I don't understand something I make sure I go and research it independently so tomorrow I am going to look into what transpose is and thus do more work on linear alegbra. 

Thoughts: I wanted to rush through and get to deep learning as quick as possible, unfortunately I am going to have to take my time a little more to make sure I understand the concepts. The postive of this is I can keep all those notes in my onenote and book and then write about them to help others, hopefully I can be a bit of a pioneer in the space (no coding and no machine learning/math of machine learning knowledge) and thus encourage others to give it a go. 

## Day 27: September 1, 2018

Today's progress: Not huge amounts of progress today I spent most of the morning understanding what is happening in 1.2.2 of the assignment. Determined to do more of it tomorrow. 

Thoughts: I had a great time walking with my partner and her friends from the split bridge to Manly. Getting outside and doing positive things for myself is so rewarding. I also had the chance to chat to Darren someone who has just completed their masters in computer science majoring in ai. He gave me some fantastic insight and the chat really excited me, which is a real positive in my mind as I was passionate and keenly interested in what he had to say about the field. It really hit home for me that this is an area I am deeply interested in and want to become more involved in. 

## Day 28: September 2, 2018

Today's progress: Again not a lot of progress today a little more work on the assigment.

Thoughts: I'm letting myself down on the weekends and I think it's potentially because I'm telling myself I will have all day to study. Instead I need to be coming into the weekend with a plan of what I need to learn and the goals for that learning. So right now I know I need to better understand how gradient descent, cost function all work to produce what we are doing in octave. I have some books to supplement that now. 

## Day 29: September 3, 2018

Today's Progress: Finished the assignment was hard! Also found this awesome series on logistic regression https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN5cNN2-HWE.

Thoughts: Revisit the math and supplement it with books

## Day 30: September 4, 2018

Today's Progress: Continued week 4 of Andrew Ng's course looking a neural networks

Thoughts: Today the math hit hard! I understood the basic concept of a neural network and how all the inputs feed into the hidden layer that is used to produce the hypothesis. However, I did not understand the calculations behind it and was a bit thrown by the course. So I've made the decision to really focus this week on linear algebra. I want to move all the pink post its to the learnt side. 

## Day 31: September 5, 2018

Today's Progress: Started taking linear algebra notes on my one note so I have a resource I can look back to

Thoughts: A combination of books, short form videos and effective not taking work the best for me. Also slowing down videos instead of trying to watch them at 2x is much better for me. I just don't take it in a 2x or probably even 1.5x so I end up rewatching the video thus making my study even more ineffective. 

## Day 32: September 6, 2018

Today's Progress: Did not do much today, minimal 15 - 30 minutes at best on linear algebra. 

Thoughts: The 10pm work night ruined me! I needed to be more disciplined when I got up at 6am and ensured I did some study. Progress is Progress after all. 

## Day 33: September 7, 2018

Today's Progress: Moved the linear independence, basis and dimension post it to the right and I think tonight dot ptoduct, modulus and negation will be moved! 

Thoughts: Make sure I include this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeMJg4uI7o0 in my notes to help others. Dr. Strang explains things wonderfully. Also add more tonight after studying! 

## Day 34: September 8, 2018

Today's Progress: Day dedicated to learning about matrix on khan academy

Thoughts: Although it feels like a backwards step, it is ok to work on the basics. I also enjoy reading and watching AI content. I have a genuine interest in this area, the thought of working withAI and building AI gives me serious excitment. 

## Day 35: September 9, 2018

Today's Progress: Continued to dedicated the day to learning about matrix on khan academy

Thoughts: I really enjoy math, I wish I had pursued it more in Univeristy. There is not time like the present I guess. 

## Day 36: September 10, 2018

Today's Progress: Nearly there with matrix got up at 5am to work on it should be done by tomorrow

Thoughts: It is interesting on the days that I don't actually look at any machine learning content and just focus on the math I still enjoy it. Really enjoy it. I just can't wait until I'm creating my own analysis and solving my own problems. Although I know it will take time.

## Day 37: September 11, 2018

Today's Progress: All done with matrices basics finished them tonight passed tests and ready to dive back into linear algebra. 

Thoughts: Feeling great about maths, you know when you have those moments when everything is click and making sense after the accumulation of hours of frustrated study...that is me right now. I need to remember that feeling. I'm not going to lie for a while there I've definitely thought as one is want to do, that I couldn't learn ML, that perhaps it was above me. However, it's not anyone can learn anything you just have to work hard to achieve it. 

I was still feeling quite tired from the range review presentation at work yesterday so studying at night and getting the motivation was hard, but I managed to get through that feeling and put in some good study. 

## Day 38: September 12, 2018

Today's progress: Quick review of vector basics to make sure I understand basic operations, then back into linear alegbra finalising dot and cross product and ready to move into Matrices in linear algebra :)

Thoughts: This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYB8IZa5AuE&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=3) = the best video for helping you to understand linear transformations! I just couldn't conceptualise it from reading Strang or even Khan academy then bam! I better understood it, although I don't doubt I will have to watch it again. This shows me that utilising a combo of resources is how I learn, I need to view something from differnet angles to better understand it. 

## Day 39: September 13, 2018

Today's progress: Pushing my way through matrices, got through one lecture on khan academy after my alarm went off late

Thoughts: I know I have been harping on about this but things are clicking. It has made me realise that going though the math is so fundamental to understanding the underlying concepts of machine learning. Going through the pain now will pay off massively down the track is my assumption. 

## Day 40: September 14, 2018

Today's progress: Worked my way through row echelon and why it is useful. All this work makes it so much easier actually understanding what Andrew Ng is talking about. 

Thoughts: The first 40 days have been fantastic, I'm looking forward to my holiday but I also can't wait to get back into it. Feeling really determined to get this done and ensure I keep my positive self talk up that I can learn the math and that I will get to where I want to go and that is making my own deep learning problemns! 

## Day 41: October 2, 2018

Today's Progress: Completed the linear alegebra section of the Andrew Ng course

Thoughts: I feel so recharged after my two weeks holiday in NZ. It is going to take a little bit of time to get back into the routine and get the brain pumping again but I'm excited about the next 60 days. 

I can't believe I missed the linear algebra section in the course the first time through!!! I'm lucky I went back to revise it. Now my plan for the week is to see how much of the course I understand after all my maths work so revision is big this week. After spending a little time on it already I realise that I shouldn't be just forcing myself forward, I should be ensuring I understand what is going on before I move on. 

## Day 42: October 3, 2018

Today's Progress: Continued revision got most of the way through week 2

Thoughts: Revision again has been fantastic, I did stumble upon an awesome video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc7RiNgHHaE. The work done in this video the exploration and the trial and error really interests me, it's why I wanted to get into ML to work on cool an engaging projects like this. 

## Day 43: October 4, 2018

Today's Progress: Week 2 nearly done for revision

Thoughts: Getting the feeling of creativity back, having some great ideas for what I want to do with Machine learning after I'm done with the basics. It's funny because with all the time I am spending learning I don't have time for one of my favourite past times gaming, but soon hopefully I will be able to automate a machine to do my gaming for me ha. 

As I take my time and go back through the course I feel like I am really grasping the concepts, redoing the assignments which I initally struggled with should be a strong litmus test for where I am at. 

## Day 44: October 5, 2018

Today's Progress: All bar one video for week 2 left to go then I am on to week 3

Thoughts: I want to finish week three tomorrow so I can do the assignment and really test where I am at. Going to be a busy weekend, I have a lot to think about espically with the job opportunity curve ball I've been through at work which would essentially mean less time for coding :( but a really good opportunity none the less and I should be able to make it work. 

## Day 45: October 6, 2018

Today's Progress: Week 2 done and throughly I would say so

Thoughts: Revision is smart, but I am also leaning towards finding a project to start soon. Either training a game or chat bot is what I am leaning towards. 

## Day 46: October 7, 2018

Today's Progress: Worked on the first assignment make sure I understood what was happening with the code and the equations

Thoughts: Spending time working on the assignment is hugely benefical, I feel more ready to tackle the next section tomorrow and then to move onto week 3, hopefully I can get to neural nets by mid week. However, I'm not going to rush it this time but rather make sure I understand what is going on. 

Machine learning is such a cool world and I want to make great projects. However, I know I am going to have to take it slow and work my way up to doing those great projects. I might even study again...

## Day 47: October 8, 2018

Today's Progress: Continued with the extra credit work on the first assignment, only got through the first part feature scaling which I'm happy about as I am really starting to get better at Octave and understanding what the code is doing

Thoughts: Although I am tempted to keep going with the lectures and revision, I have to stop myself and remember that the hard work now and the slow progress is ok. As progress is progress and the knowledge is really sinking in. 

## Day 48: October 9, 2018

Today's Progress: Finished the assignment and took detailed notes on how I figured out each section

Thoughts: The assignment was still hard but I learnt a lot more this time around than the first time I attempted it. That was through understanding the octave code and the maths behind it

## Day 49: October 10, 2018

Today's progress: Logistic regression revision continued 

Thoughts: As I update my notes, I can see I rushed through/half arsed the note taking the first time. Big time lesson that keeps coming home to roost is that if I don't understand something I need to stop and spend time to understand it before I move on. As the next video is unlikely to explain it as it assumes I've understood the past video. 

## Day 50: October 11, 2018 

Todays progress: Went through logistic regress so I had a solid understanding of it

Thoughts: This video for logistic regression is an absolute gem https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfKanl1aSG0. I has really helped my understand what is going on with the sigmoid function and how to get to the final product

## -- missed my first day in a long time work too crazy + hung over :( --

## Day 51: October 13, 2018

Today's progress: Finished week 3 revision and started assignment 3 (got up to predict.m) have regularization to go

Thoughts: A big thought struck me just a I started writing this, sometimes I need to step away from the problem and understand what it is I am trying to accomplish. A great example of this is the predict.m part of assigment 3, I was trying to run control statements to see is p was 0 or 1 not really understanding what 1 or 0 was (it is True or False) and I didn't really understand how to create a vector of these (as we are running vectorized solutions, it will automatically do this for me (p = predict(theta, X))).

Understanding what the code is doing, what has become before the code I just wrote will also really help. Such as the code in ex2.m using fminunc which gives us theta which is then used to determine p as p = 1./e+.^z or simply sigmoid(theta*X) which looks like z=W0+W1*ExamScore1+W2*ExamScore2

In the example assigment this is -25.161 + 0.206*ExamScore1 + 0.201*ExamScore2

Anyway the main point is I need to step back and understand what I want my output to be and y, then I determine which steps I need to take to get my output. 

## Day 52: October 14, 2018

Today's Progress: Finished the assignment with regularization 

Thoughts: I struggled with regularization, I understand the concept that it is to reduce overfitting it can improve the generalization performance, i.e., the performance on new, unseen data, which is exactly what we want. 

More here: [logistic regression KD nuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/06/regularization-logistic-regression.html)

I'm going to spend a night this week revising it and better understanding it. Very excited to try Neural Networks again. Also the book is going well and I don't feel as if it is taking away from my ML work. 

## Day 53: October 15, 2018

Today's Progress: Started week 4 got through the first two videos and started Model Representation I

Thoughts: My understanding of how I learn and how to learn effectively is a lot better at the moment. As soon as I don't understand something I use more resources to better understand it. 

Example is how the R^N of a netural net is worked out. Have notes to write up tonight but I am feeling confident of moving past it this time and hopefully onto making my own projects. 

## Day 54: October 16, 2018

Today's Progress: Model Representation II done

Thoughts: I have a lot a of thoughts about how much better a job I am doing taking notes. I've found a real rhythm in my rountine, lately. The Power of habit helped me out tremdously in understanding how to form a habbit. Also my focus and concerntration in the time I spend studying is more strong than before. I think this has improved for a few reasons:

1. Nootropics 
2. Building up my focus muscle 
3. Having a clear understanding of how I best learn and now implementing it - these keeps me on track and stops the feeling of feeling too lost

It's still hard working a full time job, trying to write a book as my side hustle and to learn machine learning in the middle of all that. But I want it, I want it more than I want to breathe, it is probably what I want the most out of anything at the moment. I've noticed I don't care about TV shows, NBA games or other distractions anymore I just want to spend my time learning. This makes it incredibly hard stay focused at work and I need to start implementing rules at work too keep me focused.  

## Day 55: October 17, 2018

Today's Progress: Examples and Intutitions I & II complete, understanding of XNOR also done

Thoughs: The idea that a Neural Network can create it's own features is really cool. 

I need to work more on understanding why Andrew is showing us the XNOR lessons - so going to do some video watching and reading tonight :)

There are so many cool things you can do with Neural Nets and as I learn I'll get a better sense for what I want to do. I already have a lot of projects I'm interested in. Was thinking last night about a neural net for hearth stone, that can add nodes as players pick up cards to estimate the probability of their next move. 

## Day 56: October 18, 2018

Today's Progress: Revision for week 4 done - watched first [video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLs8w1Cdi-zvavXlPXEAsWIh4Cgh83pZPO) in this series by Luis Serrano will watch the rest on the weekend

Thoughts: I have a good grasp on how Neural Networks work at the level I need to be at the moment. The hard part will be implementing it in my assignment which I am going to start tomorrow. 

When I watched Luis first video I need to pause to understand how the matrix multiplication works as my brain is not yet quick enough at comprehending that. I believe it will come with time and the good thing is I am able to understand it even though I have to stop pause and think about it. 

The idea of building something new is really exciting to me, I want to be a part of doing things for the good of humanity and I have a lot of ideas such as a computer vision program that monitors how long food has been in your fridge and sends you notification that you should eat it soon to reduce the massive food waste issue in the world. 

## Day 57: October 19, 2018

Today's Progress: Started Assignment 4 - spent a lot of time understanding the visualistion section of the code

Thoughts: Unproductive morning, I definitely feel tired. Undecided if I jump back in at night or take a night off to rest. I guess we will see if I update the log or not. 

## Day 58: October 21, 2018

Today's Progress: Finished assignment 4 and started on week 5 getting the first video done

Thoughts: Feeling really lost at the moment, had the high of writing the blog post yesterday and now have this odd low of not knowing where I am at or that I'm not good enough to do this. 

I think part of it is my boredom at work and not feeling challenged and not knowing my next move. A lot of confusion and agendas coming from others on what I should do. Really shits me. 

Machine learning is a good constant, but the struggle is so real with the assignments. Potentially how they are worded. I'm going to push through this week as I understand the material and it is mainly just the assignments I really struggle with. Also going to invest a bit more time this week in researching my next move for work. Definitely need to get out and network. 

## Day 59: October 22, 2018

Today's Progress: Another video in the series backpropagation and cost function 

Thoughts: The backpropagation video was a lot to take in, I get the basic idea of adjusting the error as we train the neural network, what I struggled with was the exact process. I will review the video and the notes tonight and it should become a lot more clear. 

I'm starting to feel confident enough to follow Jabrils advice and just start with a basic feed forward neural network that picks the colour text to put on a coloured box. 

I also read a really good article today on the skills employers are looking for when employing a data scientist, the main skill is analysis. That is being able to dervie insights from data, something I think I was quite good at when at Forethought and now at Unilever. It makes me think, it may be work looking to see what the data science team is like in the USA. 

## Day 60: October 23, 2018

Today's Progress: Worked through putting together a neural network and learn't why we randomise our weights/parameters 

Thoughts: Interesting putting the feed forward and back prop networks together. I'm watching the rest of Luis Seranno's series tonight to better help me understand. 

All day at work I think about Machine Learning and wanting to be learning about it. I'm not sure if it is because I am truely interested in it or it is because I'm just not enjoying what Im doing?

## Day 61: October 24, 2018

Today's Progress: Today I worked on the final videos in the weeks lessons and completed the quiz 

Thoughts: I've flown through the materials this week and it is either because there were less materials or I don't full understand the concepts, the assignment will show me which is correct.

## Day 62: October 25, 2018

Today's Progress: Today I worked on the assignment, I implemented unregularised cost function for FP NN

Thoughts: The assignments are challenging the tutorials make them a little easier

## Day 63: October 26, 2018

Today's Progress: Today I worked on the assignment I implemented a regularised cost function and sigmoid gradient functions, I also progressed through writing the gradient descent section of the code

Thoughts: The gradient descent part of the assignment has been quite hard, the positive is that it has taught me to better understand Octave and what the equation for gradient descent actually means. I want to do a video series to help others understand all people read the equations and convert them into Octave code.

## Day 64: October 27, 2018

Today's Progress: Today I completed the assignment for week 5

Thoughts: Great assignment and the creating content for others to use has been really beneficial in reinforcing my learning (see what I did there).

## Day 65: October 29, 2018

Today's Progress: I started the lectures for week 6

Thoughts: Today was exciting as I actually wanted to jump in and learn about bias and variance. The fundamentals excite me and I want to learn about them so I can proactively improve my models. 

## Day 66: October 30, 2018

Today's Progress: Half way through the lectures for week 6

Thoughts: I stupidly left my notebook in Melbourne so I'm going to have to transfer my notes over! I was tired this morning though and my focus was lacking so I don't see it as a bad thing and will hopefully help me retain it. 

Revision is a habit I need to better form in my work.

## Day 67: October 31, 2018

Today's Progress: Finished the lectures for week 6 and passed the quiz (4/5) will revisit  

Thoughts: Was a good feeling passing the quiz on the first attempt. After 60 days of slogging it out, I feel like it is starting to click and my knowledge is strong. Once the smaller things like what symbols mean and what a certain terms mean eg. (coefficent, polynomial) it frees up my headspace for the more important concepts. I wish there was a inital week on basics of maths or something like that so that I'm hitting the ground running in the first week focusing on the bigger picture items. 

## Day 68: November 1,  2018

Today's Progress: Started on the notes transfer and revision will finish tonight

Thoughts: Revision is great, I understand bias and variance a lot better. 

Also - skipping before I start really helps me focus and wakes me up so I'm not wasting time in the morning 

## Day 69: November 2,  2018

Today's Progress: Finished the first two sections of the assignment

Thoughts: It is encouraging to see that when I have to implement previous snippets of code and formulas from past examples I am able to do so with reasonable understanding of how to do it and what it is doing.

## Day 70: November 3,  2018

Today's Progress: Only completed one section of the assignment

Thoughts: Urgh...hungover, why do I do it to myself. Felt like such a wasted day, fell asleep trying to watch a series on neural networks. 

## Day 71: November 4,  2018

Today's Progress: Finished the assignment and got through videos on system design (error analysis, error metrics for skewed classes, trading percision and recall and data for ML)

Thoughts: Really productive day, I also enjoy the fundamentals of modelling. It is nice to understand how to improve the model and how to design the solution. 

Solution design is perhaps the most daunting part of the whole process. I like that Andrew says he spends at most 24 hours gettting together a quick and dirty solution, it really speaks to my personal preferance for how to get things done. This weeks lectures and material I have really enjoyed although I will definitely need to review in next weekend. 

## Day 72: November 5,  2018

Today's Progress: Started week 7 lectures

Thoughts: I notice I am becoming a little distracted when studying the video lectures, I've decided to reduce the time spent on them for a few days as the information isn't being absorbed past one video.

I'm going to reinforce some early learning with some more exciting and layman terms videos. Things like sentdex and Luis Seranno both of which I've mentioned previously. While my aim is still to finish the course within the 100 days which I think is entirely possible and I don't see myself missing, I also need to ensure I'm not just forcing my way through it but actually taking in what I'm learning and being able to understand the concepts to the point I can repeat it back to others. 

## Day 73: November 6, 2018

Today's Progress: Finished my one video, took good notes and watched the third video in Luis Seranno's intro to neural nets series

Thoughts: Better day today, still struggling to focus. I am looking forward to tonights meet up

## Day 74: November 7, 2018

Today's Progress: Worked through the math behind SVM optimization

Thoughts: All that early Khan academy work paid off, I already knew enough of the basics that when Andrew explained how it works for SVMs I was able to better comprehend it and then in turn I was able to spend more time on turly understanding the core concept he was trying to teach.

I am going to start putting together some basics of Math blog post for my website that hopefully others can use as a resource, rather than going through every Khan academy video like I did. 

I've been thinking a lot about what my capstone project should be and I'm coming to a few conclusions:
1. Chatbot using south park scripts
2. Inspirational quote generator using LTSM
3. Using Open AI gym to train pac man or anthoner basic game

## Day 75: November 8, 2018

Today's Progress: Completed both kernel lectures 

Thoughts: Kernels are a fantastic idea, using landmarks to create vetors of similarity is a really nice idea to then make a decision boundary. Looking forward to the assignment this week. 

## Day 76: November 9, 2018

Today's Progress: Finished all lectures on SVMs, Passed the Quiz 5/5, Watched MITOpencourse on SVM (really helpgul)

Thoughts: Despite all the progress on the math and there has been a lot of progress, watching the MIT SVMs lecture made me realise I still have a way to go. It also made me realise I do enjoy maths and solving problems, so maybe more generally I enjoy problem solving which I guess is evident in a lot of parts of my life (in the things I enjoy in my job, the type of video games I like, what I like to self learn). 

The idea of proofs doesn't sound exciting to me, although as I have never really tired perhaps I might enjoy it as I lean closer and closer to doing a gred certificate in statistics.

SVMs are a really intuitive algorithm, it is easy to visualise a street and that each street may have a different width. It's  a cool algorithm and I'm looking forward to tackling the assignment this week and cementing my knowledge in the subject. 

I also guess today marks the last 4 weeks of the challenge, I feel like I have formed a strong enough habit to continue even after the challenge. I perhaps just won't post about it daily. 

## Day 77: November 12, 2018

Today's Progress: Worked through the first two sections of the assignment for WK7

Thoughts: Getting better with understanding the assignments, can't wait to get back to Python though once I finish the course. 

I'm really glad I took the weekend off coding, brain definitely needed a refresh and I definitely have not been giving enough time to my family.

## Day 78: November 13, 2018

Today's Progress: Completed the assignment for WK7

Thoughts: The hard part was understanding the pre-written code and what the str variable was doing, I'm still not totally sure how it loops or it it is implemented through vectorisation so I need to explore what was going on in part 3 tonight. 

Will work my way through other lectures tonight, I am going to try and cram two weeks into one this week. Although not at the expense of not understanding. 

## Day 79: November 14, 2018

Today's Progress: Started WK 8 lectures - 2 down

Thoughts: Was not focused at all this morning, I am fixated on building a new PC to run my future ML projects which is stupid as I can't even run basic ones now but as they say the heart wants what the heart wants. 

I did enjoy the lecture on K-means. Such a cool concept and unsupervised learning is what I am really excited about to be honest. My new book arrived Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow looking forward to getting into this after I've finished Andrew Ng's course. 

Posting this [link](https://j253.github.io/blog/fun-with-nfl-stats.html) to remind me to do a project similar for NBA post my 100 days. 

## Day 80: November 15, 2018

Today's Progress: Continued with WK 8 lecture another 2 down

Thoughts: Again struggled with focus, I think I am getting tired of the lecture format and keep looking into the future on what I want to create. I need to remain paitent as I still do not know A LOT.

## Day 81: November 16, 2018

Today's Progress: Continued with more WK 8 lectures

Thoughts: More focused today, going to rest tonight so I can power through over the weekend. 

## Day 82: November 17, 2018

Today's Progess: Got through all the lectures in WK 8, passed all the quizzes and finished the first 2 sections of the assignment

Thoughts: Really productive day today even though I am still struggling to focus during the video lectures. 

Listening to the OCDEVL podcast shallow algorithms part 1 really helped solidify some of the things I have been learning over the last few days, espically K-Means and PCA. It reminded me how important revision is and I have made that a focus for next weekend (if possible not sure how hectic the hackathon will be). I plan to make some cheat sheets on algorithms to help me in the future when I attempt to solve my own problems. 

## Day 83: November 18, 2018

Today's Progress: Finished the WK 8 assignment, finished the density estimation lectures. 

Thoughts: Another strong day, thanks to the OCDEVL podcast the day before I have a strong understanding of what I need to learn. It can feel a little aimless as you go through, Tyler really helps explain their importance to real world examples and how you might use them. That is not to say Andrew doesn't do the same, it is just good to hear it from another source. 

Getting a bit tooey to open up my new book and start coding in Python. I really miss coding in Python everyday, I am definitely going to spend time on pybites when I finish this challenge. 

Ordered RAM for my ML rig...getting a little excited :)

## Day 84: November 19, 2018

Today's Progress: Finished all WK 9 lectures, watched 1 hour of intro to [nn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gvq9sUHPgrc&index=6&list=PLxt59R_fWVzT9bDxA76AHm3ig0Gg9S3So)

Thoughts: Massive day, I got through about 4 hours of lectures using the pomodoro technique. 

The topics covered were quite interesting, Gaussian distribution for anomaly dectection, content based recommendations, collaborative filtering and low rank matrix factorization. 

The intro to nn video was great for explaining in what I have been learning is what. What I mean by that is; say in the cost function of linear regression what is calculus and why do we use it which is something Andrew sort of brushes over or I just missed. It really helped me as I am someone who likes to understand why something is happening and that helps me connect the dots for future work. 

## Day 85: November 20, 2018

Today's Progress: First 3 sections of WK 9 assignment complete

Thoughts: There were minimal tutorials available for these sections of the assignment and through trail and error I was able to get them to work, I think this shows great progress on my part. I am trying to be more gritty in life, something I think I lacked early on in my life. 

## Day 86: November 21, 2018

Today's Progress: Last assingment finished! Only some lectures to go, started WK 10 nearly done with the lectures

Thoughts: Yewwwww! I'm done with the assignments and can start switch back to beautiful, beautiful python. I'm really grateful for MOOC's and the 100 days of code challenge, I'm not sure I would have gotten as far as I have with the course without it. I never want to stop learning. 

I'm looking forward to switching to books as I don't do very well with video, their is something about reading that helps my mind absorb information. 

I've tentively penciled in another blog post on what Machine Learning is for someone who has no idea and no right to write about it ha. 

## Day 87: November 22, 2018

Today's Progress: Completed the final 3 lectures from WK 10 and passed the quiz

Thoughts: Map reduce is something I had wondered a little about, especially when I watch things like OpenAI and Deepmind and wonder how they train their bots so quickly. It is now good to understand at a very basic level how they divide up their computational power. 

I want to make some cheat sheets of all the algorithms and techniques I have been learning recently and put them on my blog for others to use. A really good revision technique for me and hopefully helpful to others. 

Looking forward to reading HOML tonight. 

## DAY 88: November 23, 2018

Today's Progress: Completed the entire Andrew Ng course

Thoughts: I'm so proud of myself for completing this MOOC, I learn't so much and I'm going to start reinforcing my learning with personal projects.

## DAY 89 & 90: November 24 & 25, 2018

Today's Progress: Not so much progress on ML other than some article reading, I did spend a lot of time coding and picked up some awesome GitHub learnings 

Thoughts: I want to do more hackathons, I learn't so much during the weekend and met some amazing people. The purpose was to help refugees and I now have a better understanding than I did before on the issues they face. I have so much empathy for these groups and really want to be involved again. 

I worked on putting together a website for Techfugees, it is still very much a prototype. I was a little disappointed I didn't work in a larger group on solving issues directly related to refugees and that because of that I wasn't eligable to win (mostly because I am competitive) but I was there to help and I felt I did that. 

It was particularly trying because my team member pulled out on the morning of the second day and it would have really helped if they let me know the day before they weren't going to be there. In the end I got it done and I can sit back and say I'm proud of what I achieved under the circumstances I achieved it. 

## DAY 91: November 26, 2018

Today's Progress: Started on Hand's on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow

Thoughts: Going through chapter 1 was a great refresher from a lot of the Andrew Ng course. I also started to write up a post on what is machine learning and then another on what some of the challenges of Machine learning are. 

I was really tired after the weekend but happy I got up and studied. 

## Day 92: November 27, 2018

Today's Progress: Completed chapter 1 of HOML

Thoughts: Looking forward to starting on the first project in Python after I complete the exercises

## Day 93: November 28, 2018

Today's Progress: Completed the exercises at the end of chapter 1

Thoughts: I love exercises at the end of chapters really helps me cement what I've learnt

## Day 94: Novemeber 29, 2018

Today's Progress: Started Chapter 2 of HOML 

- learnt about ML project checklist and that I should use before starting any project
- how to create workspace pg40
- how to load data in to pandas (already knew but good refresher)
- how to examine rows object.head()
- how to get desription of categorical data
- how to further examine attributes object.describe()
- how to plot data

Thoughts: Today was cool, I love using python, want to get better at jupyter notebooks and pandas. The book helps me achieve all these. 

It also gives me good ideas for mini blog posts and even code snippets for my instagram

## Day 95: December 1, 2018

Today's Progess: Work through the create a test set section of chapter 2 

- leant how to use hash to split training set and test set
- learnt how to use indexs to spilt training data and test set
- learnt what stratified sampling is
- learnt how the permutation method works in numpy

Thoughts: A few months out of python has me doing a bit of reminder work, which actually reminds me I need to understand what iloc and loc does. 

## Day 96: December 2, 2018

Today's Progress: Understand how I need to daul boot my new PC, read through articles from Jason Brownlee - Machine Learning mastery

Thoughts: A short day today, going to get back into HOML tomorrow. Love that this journey is going to take time.

## Day 97: December 3, 2018

Today's Progress: Worked on Chpt2 Plotting and exploring data as well as writing functions to clean data

Thoughts: Nearly done with the challenge, not close to being done with this journey.
